# miniCRM

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This miniCRM is a result of diploma thesis of JavaScript education course at Skillbox.
It is based on Node.js emulated server, which was build by school mentioned before.
My task was to make all frontend components and configure data exchange with server.
All backend part ('/crm-backend') was made by Skillbox's command. Only extension is that server side 'index.js' was manualed
to be compatible with my domain based on Node.js VPS server http://www.ksvf.online

To start testing, follow the instructions below:
1. Open root directory ('miniCRM' folder) in your IDE.
2. Launch 'miniCRM/index.html' file with *LiveServer*. That will help to avoid CORS Policy and other issues.

I hope you will enjoy it. Thank you for your attention.
I will be really appreciated, if you leave a feedback by any possible way.
